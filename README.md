Here this repository give you my Artificial Intelligence-Machine Learning Codes.
What I studied during the AI-ML course at Eduspark International Pvt. Ltd. Pune.

1.File Name: Back to Basics
 In this file python basic concepts are   covered.

2.File Name: Day 1 and 2 Numpy and Pandas
 In this File Basic Numpy and Pandas.

3.File Name: Plotting on nhl dataset
 In this file I worked on nhl dataset,   I done some plotting task.

4.File Name: Data Cleaning Techniques 
 In this file I worked on Data Cleaning  Techniques used in AI/ML.

5.File Name: Amazon Sales {EDA} 
 In this file I performed exploratory    data analysis on the dataset called     amazon sales.
 Amazon_sales.csv file is used as        mentioned.

6.File Name:            data_cleaning_challenge_handling_missing_values
